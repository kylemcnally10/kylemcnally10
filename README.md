### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I embarked on my journey into Software Development just last year and found a welcoming community at Coding Dojo. During my time there, I honed my coding skills, developed problem-solving abilities, and cultivated collaboration. I successfully mastered three full stacks, namely Python/Flask, MERN, and C#/.NET, and completed projects deployed via AWS in each stack. Remarkably, I entered the program with no prior coding experience and emerged as one of the top students in my class.

Before this past year, my life was predominantly centered around basketball. I dedicated four years to playing at Willamette University, followed by seven years as a coach. As a coach, I not only cherished my role as a player but also found great fulfillment in passing on my knowledge and passion to the next generation. Within a couple of years, I assumed a managerial role of the local club I was coaching, becoming the primary point of contact for parents, players, tournament directors, and club management, overseeing more than 10 teams at one point. This role equipped me with valuable managerial experience and furthered my growth as a leader.

While majoring in economics at Willamette, I initially believed that the finance industry would be my lifelong career path. My post-graduation role in wealth management and operations at Beacon Pointe taught me to thrive in a fast-paced team environment. I collaborated daily with team members and clients to craft powerful solutions for complex challenges. Although I cherished my time in retail wealth management, the people I worked with, and the opportunities I had, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was a better fit for me.

My passion for technology and all that it encompasses was always present, but I held misinformed perceptions about coding and software development. However, once I dove into the subject, I immediately recognized it as the space I wanted to be in. My dream is to find a company that blends my passion for software development with my other interests, including finance, economics, athletics, gaming, and more. I now have a clear vision of my life's path, and I've never been more excited to embark on this new journey. All the experiences in my life have led me to this opportunity, and I eagerly anticipate what the future holds.
