### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Until this past year, my entire life has been basketball. I played all four years at the collegiate level and then spent the next seven as a coach. I always had a love for the game as a player, but found passing on my knowledge and passion to the next generation as a coach even more fulfilling. Coaching and running a club taught me valuable lessons and helped me grow as a leader and a role-model, among many other things. 
Â 
Having majored in economics at Willamette University, I always thought the finance industry was going to be where I would spend my life as a professional. Working in wealth management and operations taught me how to work in a fast paced team environment, something I thrived in from my life experience in basketball. I collaborated daily with team members and clients alike to find powerful solutions to complex problems. While I enjoyed the time I spent in wealth management, the people I worked with, and the opportunities I had, I knew there was something that I could find more passion in. 
Â 
Once I made the plunge into Software Development, I found a home at Coding Dojo and havenâ€™t looked back. Throughout my time there, I honed my skills in coding, problem solving, and collaborating, etc. I learned three full stacks (Python/Flask, MERN, and C#/.NET) and created, built, and deployed projects via AWS in each of the three stacks and I look forward to continuing to learn and grow as I progress in my career. 

I know now more than ever what I want to do in my life and Iâ€™ve never been more excited to get started on a new journey. All my experiences in life have led to this opportunity and I look forward to what lies next.
Â 
Iâ€™m currently seeking a role as a Full Stack Software Engineer so please feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to connect!
